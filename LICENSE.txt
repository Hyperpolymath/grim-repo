The Palimpsest License
Version 0.8, January 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 GrimRepo Contributors

PREAMBLE

The Palimpsest License recognizes that software development involves not just
code, but human relationships, emotional labor, and community safety. This
license extends traditional open source permissions with explicit guarantees
around emotional safety, reversibility, and community health.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. GRANT OF RIGHTS

   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
   copy of this software and associated documentation (the "Work"), to use,
   copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies
   of the Work, subject to the following conditions:

2. ATTRIBUTION

   The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Work.

3. EMOTIONAL SAFETY GUARANTEES

   3.1 RIGHT TO REVERSIBILITY
       All contributors retain the right to experiment without permanent
       consequences. Failed experiments, abandoned features, and reverted
       changes shall not be held against contributors in any way.

   3.2 ANTI-HARASSMENT PROTECTION
       No person shall use this Work as a vector for harassment, doxxing,
       emotional manipulation, or coordinated attacks against contributors
       or users.

   3.3 ANXIETY REDUCTION
       Documentation and contribution processes shall prioritize clarity and
       psychological safety. Confusing or anxiety-inducing patterns should
       be treated as bugs.

4. COMMUNITY HEALTH

   4.1 CONSTRUCTIVE CRITIQUE
       Code review and technical critique must focus on the work, not the
       person. Personal attacks, dismissiveness, and condescension are
       prohibited.

   4.2 INCLUSIVE PARTICIPATION
       The Work shall remain accessible to people of varying skill levels,
       backgrounds, and neurotypes. Gatekeeping is prohibited.

   4.3 SUSTAINABLE MAINTENANCE
       Maintainers have the right to sustainable work practices, including
       the right to step back, delegate, or hand off maintenance without
       guilt or pressure.

5. TRANSPARENT GOVERNANCE

   5.1 DECISION VISIBILITY
       Significant project decisions should be documented and visible.
       Backroom deals and clique-based governance are discouraged.

   5.2 CONTRIBUTOR VOICE
       Regular contributors should have meaningful input into project
       direction, proportional to their sustained engagement.

6. NO WARRANTY

   THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
   CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
   TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK
   OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.

8. ENFORCEMENT

   Violations of the emotional safety and community health provisions may
   result in:
   - Temporary or permanent ban from project spaces
   - Revocation of commit access
   - Public documentation of violations (with consent of affected parties)

   Enforcement decisions should be made transparently by maintainers in
   consultation with affected community members.

9. COMPATIBILITY

   This license is compatible with the MIT License, Apache 2.0, and other
   permissive open source licenses. The additional provisions apply only
   to community interaction, not to code usage rights.

10. TERMINATION

    This license is perpetual unless explicitly terminated by copyright
    holders. Individual violators of community health provisions may have
    their participation rights terminated while the license remains in
    effect for other users.
