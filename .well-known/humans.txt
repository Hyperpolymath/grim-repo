/* PHILOSOPHY */

GrimRepo embodies the belief that:

1. Structure is not just organization — it's clarity, onboarding, and symbolic trust
2. Repositories should be narratable, audit-grade, and emotionally legible
3. Software development involves human relationships, not just code
4. Emotional safety is a feature, not a luxury
5. Reversibility reduces anxiety and encourages experimentation
6. Type safety and memory safety prevent entire classes of bugs
7. Offline-first architecture respects privacy and enables air-gapped environments
8. Open source should be sustainable, not exploitative

/* DESIGN PRINCIPLES */

- Offline-first: No network dependencies
- Type-safe: Leverage TypeScript's type system
- Memory-safe: Immutable patterns, no buffer overflows
- Zero runtime dependencies: Self-contained execution
- Modular: Clear separation of concerns
- Testable: 100% test coverage goal
- Documented: Every public API explained
- Accessible: Welcoming to all skill levels

/* RSR COMPLIANCE */

This project achieves Bronze-level Rhodium Standard Repository compliance:

✓ 100+ lines of code with zero runtime dependencies
✓ Type safety via TypeScript strict mode
✓ Memory safety through immutable patterns
✓ Offline-first - no network dependencies
✓ Complete documentation (README, LICENSE, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT)
✓ .well-known/ directory (security.txt, ai.txt, humans.txt)
✓ Build system (justfile, Nix flake)
✓ CI/CD pipeline (.gitlab-ci.yml)
✓ 100% test pass rate
✓ TPCF Perimeter 3 - Community Sandbox (open contribution)

/* FUN FACTS */

- This project was bootstrapped to be self-hosting (dogfooding our own tools)
- The name "GrimRepo" suggests serious, audit-grade rigor with a wink
- "Rhodium" in RSR refers to the precious metal (rare, valuable, durable)
- Our badge says "Emotionally legible by design" - we mean it!
