## Emotional Safety Provisions

As part of our [Palimpsest License](LICENSE.txt) commitment, we extend traditional codes of conduct with **explicit emotional safety guarantees**:

### Right to Reversibility
- Failed experiments and abandoned features are **not held against contributors**
- You may withdraw proposals, close PRs, or change your mind **without guilt**
- Mistakes are **learning opportunities**, not permanent marks

### Anxiety Reduction
- **No "stupid questions"** - all questions are valid
- **Ask for help early and often** - struggling in silence is unnecessary
- **Take breaks** - burnout prevention is a community responsibility
- **Clear documentation** - confusing processes are treated as bugs

### Sustainable Contribution
- Maintainers may **step back without guilt** when needed
- **No unpaid emotional labor expectations** - saying "no" is acceptable
- **Boundaries are respected** - response times, availability, scope

### Inclusive Communication
- **Accommodate different neurotypes** - literal communication is OK
- **Avoid jargon when possible** - explain technical terms
- **Multiple communication styles** - async and sync, text and voice
